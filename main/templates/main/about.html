        <h1>Brilliant Imagery</h1>
        <p>Brillinat Imagery is a package and app for working with DNG images and image sequences.
            It can do things such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Parse DNG files and read their metadata.</li>
            <li>Render DNG files.</li>
            <li>Render lossless JPEG files.</li>
            <li>Smooth transitions between Adobe Lightroom edits in image sequences.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>It's built in a modular fashion so it can be used as a standalone app, extended, or used
            to extend the capabilities of something else.</p>
        <p>Also, please note that this project has largely been my first, primary, and/or only
            exposure to things such as Python, Cython, Django, structuring projects and packaged,
            packaging Python projects, software documentation, data compression, binary data and
            files, image rendering and manipulation,
            image files and their structures, web development and hosting and lots more.
            If you have questions, comment, or
            recommendations, please reach out either here or on the project's
